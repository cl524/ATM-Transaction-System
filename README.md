# ATM Transaction Database
In this project, I establish a database system to perfrom ATM transaction functions.

There is an administrator in this system database.
An administrator can add users (bank customers) into system database.

As users log into system, they can operate the system like an ATM.
They can make deposit and withdraw money into and from their bank account.
Also they can check account balance whenever they like.
